# At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What is HTML
- How do you create an HTML page?
- What is a markup language?
- What is the DOM?
- What is an element / tag?
- What is an attribute?
- How does the browser load a webpage?
- What is CSS?
- How do you add style to an element?
- What is a class?
- What is a selector?
- How do you compute CSS Specificity Value?
- What are Box properties in CSS?

- During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you canâ€™t apply any design.
